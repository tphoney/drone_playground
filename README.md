***DO NOT CHECK CREDENTIALS INTO THIS REPO***

## This repository

This contains lots of different kinds of builds as listed below. Just follow their instructions to try them out.

After you have forked this repository.

There are a couple ways to try it out.

  1. Run this on your installation of Drone. You will be able to add your forked repository, and then run builds.
  2. Run this on [cloud.drone.io](cloud.drone.io) You will need to have an established github account. Once you log into cloud.drone.io you will be able to add your forked repository, and then run builds.
  3. Follow the instructions for setting up drone in aws, at the bottom of this readme. You will be able to add your forked repository, and then run builds.

## Drone Basics

### Conditionals

Here is a concrete example of conditional usage in drone. For more complex usage look [here](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/conditions/)
To try this build. In the settings of this repo in you drone ui. Set the path for the drone file to `./basic/conditional.yml`

For more advanced information on Java builds go [here](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/kubernetes/examples/language/java/)

## Running and installing Drone in AWS using Github as the git provider

**THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION** **THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION**

The setup here is for testing purposes only, there are settings here that are inherently insecure (the open ssh/http ports).

### AWS setup

- Go to your EC2 [dashboard](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-2#Home:) we are using Ohio region us-east-2
- Click on the Launch Instance button
- On screen `1` Ubuntu 20.04 - You may need to click the subscribe button to get the latest image.
- On screen `2` t2.medium 4gb mem
- On screen `3` In advanced details - inside 'user data' paste in the following

```BASH
#cloud-config
users:
- default
- name: root
  sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

```

This script installs docker, docker-compose, vim and creates '/root/docker-compose.yml' for you.

- On screen `4` select the storage size
- On screen `5` add any neccessary tags
- On screen `6` set up a security group to allow ports 80 and 22 (http/ssh) from anywhere.
- Review your settings, finally select your key pair you have created / or create a new key pair.

### Setting up Github Oauth

- Setup [Github Oauth](https://github.com/settings/developers)
- Set the home page to `http://localhost` * this is not important
- Set the `Authorization callback URL` to `http://${AWS_HOSTNAME}/login`
- Create your client id and secret. Keep these safe !! this is the only time you will see these.

### Running Drone

- SSH into the box as ubuntu using your aws pem file `ssh -i key_pair.pem ubuntu@${AWS_HOSTNAME}`. Use whatever your key pair is called.
- Change to the root user `sudo su`
- Change directory into the root folder `cd /root`
- Edit the docker compose file `vim docker-compose.yml`

Changing the following 3 settings

```BASH
DRONE_SERVER_HOST=${AWS_HOSTNAME}                          # your aws instance hostname
DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=${DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}           # taken from your Github oauth application
DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=${DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}   # taken from your Github oauth application
```

- Run the following command to start the Docker containers `docker-compose up`. You should see the Drone server and Drone runner start.
- Open a browser and go to `http://{AWS_HOSTNAME}`

### Mysql database

Code lives here in the `mysql` folder, it runs a mysql service in a basic `.drone.yaml` file that:

- mysql service that runs the database
- mysql health check that waits on the mysql service to come up
- DDL sql step to create and insert data into a table
- DML sql step to get data from the table

To try this build. In the settings of this repo in you drone ui. Set the path for the drone file to `./mysql/.drone.yml`

For more advanced information on services go here `https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/kubernetes/syntax/services/`

## TODO's

- Add workspace setting for golang .drone.yml, to remove cd hack.
